# SocialVerse
Introducing our revolutionary new app that combines the best features of WhatsApp and Instagram, providing you with an all-in-one social media experience. With our live chat and audio and video call features, you can easily stay connected with your friends and family, no matter where they are in the world. Whether you're looking to catch up with loved ones or hold a business meeting, our app makes it easy to stay in touch with the people who matter most.

In addition to our messaging capabilities, we also offer a built-in payment portal, similar to UPI apps, which allows for seamless transactions between users. You can easily send and receive money with just a few taps, making it easy to split bills or send money to loved ones.

Our app also offers features similar to Instagram, including stories, posts, reels and a feed page, so you can easily share your experiences and connect with other users. We have used Firebase as the backend and have implemented various machine learning techniques for optimization, ensuring that our app runs smoothly and efficiently.

Our app also comes with a fully integrated photo and video editor, so you can create and share stunning content. Whether you're looking to capture a beautiful sunset or a special moment with friends, our editor makes it easy to create and share high-quality content.

We have used Java for the Android Studio development and JavaScript for backend cloud messaging and storage management. The app is built in such a way it will be compatible with all the latest versions of Android and also the app is optimized for smooth performance.

Though the app is not yet available for download, we have embedded a YouTube link showcasing the features of the app and a working demo. This will give you a glimpse of what our app has to offer and you can see for yourself how it can simplify your social media experience.
